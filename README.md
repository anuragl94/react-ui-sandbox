## React UI Sandbox
This project was intended to give an easy to use inline state editor for developers to quickly test changes. Sometimes using the React Dev tools feels clunky due to the nesting of the state. Also, there are no options to modify the data type of the state as needed. With this editor, you can quickly create a new state and attach them to UI components to see how they behave.
